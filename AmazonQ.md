Generated: 2025-08-30T06:18:06.333797
Model: IHD
Current Status: training

### OBJECTIVE
Continue training IHD model for aneurysm detection improvement.

### CURRENT METRICS
- Best DICE Score: 0.0000
- Training Iterations: 0
- Last Checkpoint: None

### REQUIRED ACTIONS
1. Check if training/validation/testing is currently running
2. If not running, resume from last checkpoint
3. Target DICE improvement: > 0.8500
4. Implement the following optimizations:
   - Use episodic training with memory bank (IRIS framework)
   - Apply data augmentation on query and reference images
   - Use 75%/5%/20% train/validation/test split
   - Batch size: 32, Iterations: 80K minimum
   - Optimizer: LAMB with warmup

### TRAINING PARAMETERS
```python
config = {
    'batch_size': 32,
    'learning_rate': 1e-4,
    'optimizer': 'LAMB',
    'scheduler': 'cosine_annealing',
    'augmentation': True,
    'memory_bank': True,
    'context_ensemble': True,
    'iterations': 80000,
    'val_frequency': 1000,
    'save_frequency': 5000,
    'early_stopping_patience': 10
}
```

### CHECKPOINT STRATEGY
- Save checkpoint when validation DICE improves
- Keep best 3 checkpoints
- Save final model after 80K iterations

### ERROR HANDLING
If training fails:
1. Check GPU memory availability
2. Reduce batch size if OOM
3. Check data loader integrity
4. Verify checkpoint compatibility

### SUCCESS CRITERIA
- DICE score > 0.8500
- Successful validation on test set
- Model saved to checkpoints/

## Automated Training Continuation - 2025-08-30 06:34:33

The training monitor has detected that ihd training has stopped.
Current best DICE score: 0.0000
Last checkpoint: None

### Instructions for continuation:
1. Resume from the latest checkpoint
2. Continue training until improvement in aneurysm detection DICE score
3. Target: Achieve DICE score > 0.0100
4. Save checkpoint when improvement is detected
5. Implement early stopping if no improvement after 10 epochs

### Training parameters to adjust if needed:
- Learning rate decay if plateauing
- Increase augmentation if overfitting
- Adjust batch size for memory optimization
